# Talk application
We invite applicants for the following sessions to write an application in the
form of a *GitHub issue* in this repository. The application deadline is _May 19th_.
We will make a selection based on quality, relevance, community interest and
balance of the program by _May 24th_. We invite everybody to interact and upvote
the issues. This will give us an indication about community interest that we will
also take into consideration.

## Oral sessions and demos
_20 minutes + 5 minutes of questions (3 per session)_
### 1. Open science in policies and regulations
How are journals, granting agencies, and consortia working alongside the open science movement? This session will explore recently introduced policy changes from each of these groups, focusing on their motivations and the potential impact on the academic ecosystem.
### 2. From statistical to biological validity
The statistical significance, reproducibility, and replicability of results does not necessarily make them biologically meaningful. Current efforts towards reproducible and statistically reliable results, therefore, need to expand to also assess the biological validity of findings. This session will focus on efforts to address the biological validity of neuroimaging results, with particular emphasis on how this can be done in an open and transparent fashion.
### 3. Demo: New advances in open neuroimaging methods
In this session, the speakers will present recently developed open source methods on a variety of topics. They will walk you through a short hands-on demo with their toolbox on real data in real-time.
### 4. Web-based solutions in neuroscience
Although the web has transformed our commerce, communication, and media consumption; its impacts are not yet fully realized in neuroimaging research. This session will explore the potential of web applications for solving neuroscientific problems.

## Lightning talks
_5 minutes + 5 minutes of questions (6 per session)_
### 1. Neuroscience toolkit
Although the field is still grappling with big questions of reproducibility and replicability, practical questions such as “how do I best plot by results”, or “how do I get my data in a format to use this new toolbox” still present the largest source of concern for many neuroscientists. This session will feature six lightning talks that discuss open source hands-on solutions for everyday real-world problems.
### 2. Machine learning in neuroscience
[description pending]

### 3. Collaborative research and team science
From cross-lab collaborations to collaboration in big consortia, working collaboratively can provide a lot of benefits to science and to scientists. Yet it may also introduce new challenges in terms of communication, data analysis, and authorship. This session will explore the benefits of collaboration and ways to overcome the challenges.

# Scheduled meetings in the Open Science Room
The OSR will also be open to scheduled conversations and discussions about various topics of open science outside. You can submit requests via a GitHub issue in this repository. The calendar is 
 available [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=anJjNGh1dXFtODkyazVpbzk3OXF2YmM2N29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
